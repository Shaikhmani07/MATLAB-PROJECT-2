  Its a MATLAB project "WORD RECOGNITION" The speech is primary mode of communication among human being and also the most natural and efficient form of exchanging information among human in speech. So, it is only logical that the next technological development to be natural language speech recognition. Speech Recognition can be defined as the process of converting speech signal to a sequence of words by means Algorithm implemented as a computer program. Speech processing is one of the exciting areas of signal processing. The goal of speech recognition area is to developed technique and system to developed for speech input to machine based on major advanced in statically modeling of speech ,automatic speech recognition today find widespread application in task that require human machine interface such as automatic call processing.
